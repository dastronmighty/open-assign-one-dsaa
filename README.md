# COMP20010 Tutorial 1

This repository contains some starter code for Tutorial 1.

This tutorial is not formally assessed.

For this tutorial you should:

1. Implement the classes GameEntry, Scoreboard
2. Write a main function which reads the scores from “scores.txt”
3. Print out the resulting score board

Things to think about:
- Can you think of other (better?) ways to implement the add() function?
- What other kinds of exceptions should your code handle?
